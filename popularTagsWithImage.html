        <p> Do you not know? Have you not heard? The <b>LORD</b> is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He will not grow tired or weary, and his understanding no one can fathom. He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak.  Even youths grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall. but those who hope in the <strong>LORD will renew their strength</strong>. <u>They will soar on wings like <i>eagles</i></u>; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.</p>
